<p>I'm a software developer based in Bristol. I currently work for the platform team at <a href="https://lostmy.name">Lost My Name</a> where I build services that render personalised books (and posters and games) with speed and scale. I also run <a href="https://wrightsnotes.com">WrightsNotes</a> which provides notebooks with customised paper.</p>

<p>I use number of tools to get these jobs done. Some recurring ones include: Golang, Javascript, Scala and Ruby.</p>

<p>Other skills I deploy; managing people; managing remote teams; tech leading - sprint planning, roadmapping etc.</p>
