I gave a talk at [Bristol JS](http://www.meetup.com/BristolJS/) about my experiences of writing a small framework-less front-end app for [wrightsnotes.com](https://wrightsnotes.com). Unfortunately it was not recorded but the slides provide some info on how I have structured the code base. In summary: I used one package, [virtual dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) to provide react-like virtual dom building and diffing functionality and I've build a small app around it. I've handled state using an action dispatch & reduce pattern and I've written small helper functions to smooth over any browser API inconsistencies that might bite me.

The new shiny website referred to in the deck is [wrightsnotes.co/wrights/new](https://www.wrightsnotes.com/wrights/new). The crappy website will [make your eyes bleed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnTRrpehe6g) so I will refrain from sharing.
