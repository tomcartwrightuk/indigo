This week I released socket.io-p2p under the socket.io banner. The announcement post can be found [here](http://socket.io/blog/socket-io-p2p/).
## Tl;dr

Socket.io-p2p provides the socket.io and protocol over a peer-to-peer WebRTC connection with a fallback to server-based communication when clients do not support WebRTC. The snake game on the home page of this blog uses the library to setup two-player games by pairing clients as they connect to the server and allowing them to practise the game while they wait for a partner to join.
